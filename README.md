# Random-Password-Generator

This is a random password generator that uses the random module to select input randomly from a long string of (generally) accepted characters in passwords.

This password generator also provides an interface for the user. If you're not interested in that and only the components to make the password generator,
then one really only needs lines 2, 5, and 8-17 (If you do copy just the code for the generator make sure to edit lines 16 and 17 as print output).

The .py file has the code and the .exe file will run the file with the interface. Either way, simply give the code two inputs- how long you want your password
to be in the top box and how many passwords you want in the bottom- and hit submit, and the program will generate whatever you request.
